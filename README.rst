Sublime-haskell-cabal
=====================


Syntax for haskell cabal files for sublime text 2, and maybe textmate.


Getting Started
===============

- Install `Sublime-haskell-cabal`_


If you're running a full installation of Sublime Text, simply doublelick on the
``.sublime-package`` file. If you're running a portable installation, you need
to perform an `installation by hand`_.
