Syntax for haskell cabal files for sublime text 2, and maybe textmate.


Getting Started
===============

- Install `%(package_name)s`_

.. _%(package_name)s: https://

If you're running a full installation of Sublime Text, simply doublelick on the
``.sublime-package`` file. If you're running a portable installation, you need
to perform an `installation by hand`_.

.. _installation by hand: http://sublimetext.info/docs/extensibility/packages.html#installation-of-packages-with-sublime-package-archives

Once installed, run the following command from the Python console (``Ctrl+```)::

      view.run_command("COMMAND")

Alternatively, you can define a new key binding for this command.
